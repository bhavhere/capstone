# plantas-a flutter app for detection of fungal and algae diseases in plant leaves

---

**Project Overview:**

The primary objective of this project was to develop an intelligent system capable of recognizing various crop diseases and recommending appropriate pesticides based on real-time data. The solution leverages a **pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN)**, which achieves an impressive accuracy of approximately **97%** in disease detection.

### Key Features:

1. **Disease Recognition:**
   The system uses a **convolutional neural network (CNN)**, trained on a large dataset of plant images, to detect and classify crop diseases with high accuracy. This enables rapid and accurate identification of potential diseases in crops.

2. **Pesticide Recommendation:**
   Once a disease is detected, the system recommends the most suitable pesticides, helping farmers make informed decisions about crop care.

3. **REST API with FastAPI:**
   A robust **REST API** was developed using **FastAPI**, which serves as the backbone for communication between the mobile application and the backend. This API is deployed on the **Heroku cloud platform**, ensuring scalability and reliability.

4. **Flutter Mobile Application:**
   The solution is accessible via a **Flutter-based Android application**. This user-friendly mobile app allows users to upload snapshots of their crops directly from their phones. The uploaded images are processed by the server to detect diseases and recommend suitable treatments.

5. **Cloud Deployment:**
   The system is hosted on **Heroku**, ensuring that users can access the service anytime with just an internet connection, eliminating the need for complex setup or hardware dependencies.

### Benefits:

- **Ease of Use:** The application is **free**, easy to use, and only requires a smartphone and an internet connection to function.
- **Convenience:** Farmers can identify crop diseases and receive pesticide recommendations without the need for extensive technical knowledge or specialized equipment.
- **Scalable Solution:** Hosted on the cloud, the system is designed to scale and handle high volumes of requests, making it suitable for use by a large number of users.

### Conclusion:

This plant disease detection software is an innovative, user-friendly solution that empowers farmers to quickly identify crop diseases and take appropriate action to protect their crops. By combining cutting-edge machine learning technology with a mobile-first approach, the project offers a practical tool that can significantly enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability.
