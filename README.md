# plantas-a flutter app for detection of fungal and algae diseases in plant leaves
<b>The major goal of this project was to develop a system that can recognize various crop diseases and recommend suitable pesticides if there is any disease.

To achieve this goal, a pre-trained convolutional neural network was developed and which is capable of obtaining an accuracy close to 97%. Using FastAPI, a REST API server is developed, which is deployed on the Heroku cloud platform. Using this online server, our flutter android application is capable of predicting the diseases from snapshots uploaded from the application alone. The end result is a plant disease detection software. The application is free, easy to use, and requires for only a phone and a web connection.
